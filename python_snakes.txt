Python Snakes (The Animal)

Python is a group of large non-venomous snakes found mainly in Africa,
Asia, and Australia. They are among the largest snakes in the world and
are known for their strength and ability to constrict prey.

Key Characteristics: - Non-venomous constrictors - Strong muscular
bodies - Heat-sensing pits to detect prey - Excellent swimmers

Common Species: - Indian Python (Python molurus) - Burmese Python
(Python bivittatus) - Reticulated Python (Malayopython reticulatus) -
Ball Python (Python regius)

Habitat: Python snakes live in forests, grasslands, swamps, and near
water bodies. Some species adapt well to human-modified environments.

Diet: They typically eat mammals, birds, and reptiles. They kill prey by
constriction rather than venom.

Interesting Facts: - Some pythons can grow over 20 feet long. - They
swallow prey whole. - Female pythons sometimes guard and warm their
eggs.

Conservation: Some python species are threatened due to habitat loss and
illegal wildlife trade.
